# consulars-origins-master

Consular's Origins is an add-on for the Origins mod. It adds several new origins to fit neatly with many different play styles.

This mod is completely open source. I really couldn't care less what you do with it.

Thanks to Apace100 for creating the original Origins mod.

This mod does require Pehkui and Origins to run properly.

A forge port is planned. But I'm in no rush to make it. You're welcome to do it yourself if you really want.
